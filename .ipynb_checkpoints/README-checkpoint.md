## ðŸ§ª Experiments and Ablation Study

We conduct the following experiments:

| Experiment Branch      | Description |
|:------------------------|:------------|
| `original_grpo`         | Original GRPO algorithm (baseline). |
| `improved_advantage`    | Only the advantage estimation improved. |
| `improved_reward`       | Only the reward function improved. |
| `improved_objective`    | Only the objective function improved. |
| `full_improvement`      | All improvements applied together. |

Results are saved under the `results/` directory, categorized by experiment.
